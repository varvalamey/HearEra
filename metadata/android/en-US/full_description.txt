hearera offers a clean and intuitive interface for listening to audio files while keeping track of your listening progress.

<b>Additional features include:</b>

• export and import your listening progress as sql database

• lock screen media controls

<b>Usage</b>
Start off by adding directories to your library. When adding a new directory you have two options:
• You can add a directory that contains audio files
• You can add a directory that contains subdirectories which contain audio files

For example, you might have a directory <i>Podcast History Hour</i> that contains audio files. Add this directory to your library using the option <i>Add directory that contains audio files</i>.
Additionally, you might have a directory <i>AudioBooks</i> that contains subdirectories such as <i>The Hobbit</i> or <i>Harry Potter II</i> each of which contains one or several audio files. You can add this directory to your library using the option <i>Add directory with subdirectories that contain audio files</i>.
This prevents you from having to add your audio books one by one.

Add cover images to the subdirectories to have a neat looking app as shown in the screenshots.
